        "In this practical assignment, we explore the concepts of **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)** by implementing and training a convolutional VAE on the MNIST dataset. The primary objectives are to learn how VAEs encode data into a structured latent space and to investigate how this latent space can be leveraged for generating new data and understanding data features.\n",

        "### Key Learning Goals:\n",
        "1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the MNIST dataset and prepare it for training a convolutional neural network.\n",
        "2. **VAE Architecture**: Define a VAE model with convolutional layers for encoding and decoding images, including a reparameterization trick to ensure smooth sampling from the latent space.\n",
        "3. **VAE Loss Function**: Understand and implement the VAE loss, which combines reconstruction loss and KL-divergence to balance accurate reconstructions with a regularized latent space.\n",
        "4. **Model Training**: Train the VAE model on MNIST, observe loss trends, and understand the impact of balancing reconstruction quality and latent space regularization.\n",
        "5. **Latent Space Visualization**: Perform latent space interpolation by linearly blending between two points in the latent space, generating smooth transitions between two digit classes."

        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization and Latent Dimension**:\n",
        "   - `latent_dim=2` is defined as the dimensionality of the latent space. Setting it to a low number (e.g., 2) makes the latent space easy to visualize.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Encoder**:\n",
        "   - The encoder consists of three convolutional layers:\n",
        "     - The first layer transforms the input image of size 1x28x28 to a feature map of size 32x14x14.\n",
        "     - The second layer further reduces it to a size of 64x7x7.\n",

        "     - The first layer reshapes it to 64x7x7.\n",
        "     - The second layer outputs 32x14x14.\n",
        "     - The final layer produces the original shape, 1x28x28, with pixel values normalized between 0 and 1 using a Sigmoid activation.\n",
        "\n",
