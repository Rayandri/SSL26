        "In this practical assignment, we explore the concepts of **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)** by implementing and training a convolutional VAE on the MNIST dataset. The primary objectives are to learn how VAEs encode data into a structured latent space and to investigate how this latent space can be leveraged for generating new data and understanding data features.\n",

        "1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the MNIST dataset and prepare it for training a convolutional neural network.\n",
        "2. **VAE Architecture**: Define a VAE model with convolutional layers for encoding and decoding images, including a reparameterization trick to ensure smooth sampling from the latent space.\n",
        "3. **VAE Loss Function**: Understand and implement the VAE loss, which combines reconstruction loss and KL-divergence to balance accurate reconstructions with a regularized latent space.\n",
        "4. **Model Training**: Train the VAE model on MNIST, observe loss trends, and understand the impact of balancing reconstruction quality and latent space regularization.\n",
        "5. **Latent Space Visualization**: Perform latent space interpolation by linearly blending between two points in the latent space, generating smooth transitions between two digit classes."

        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization and Latent Dimension**:\n",
        "   - `latent_dim=2` is defined as the dimensionality of the latent space. Setting it to a low number (e.g., 2) makes the latent space easy to visualize.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Encoder**:\n",
        "   - The encoder consists of three convolutional layers:\n",

        "     - The second layer further reduces it to a size of 64x7x7.\n",

        "     - The first layer reshapes it to 64x7x7.\n",
        "     - The second layer outputs 32x14x14.\n",

        "The visualization showcases the VAE’s ability to generate new images by sampling from the latent space. The smooth transition between digits demonstrates that the VAE has learned a well-structured, continuous latent space where similar concepts (like digits) are located close to each other. This capability can be useful for generating synthetic data or exploring variations in features.\n",
